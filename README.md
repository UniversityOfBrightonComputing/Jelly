Orion
=====

Orion is a java 2D platformer game engine with easy API. The main purpose of the project is to learn and practise relatively clean java code and experiment with a wide range of API provided by Java SE libraries.
Jelly is a Mario style game based on the Orion engine. This project is a concurrent development of both entities

Source Code
===========

As a foundation of the main game loop I am using a modified version of Mike Smith's suggested MVC approach.
(The original MVC implementation can be found here: http://www.it.brighton.ac.uk/staff/mas/mas/courses/ci101.java/home.html under "mini-projects")
When contributing to the code use javadoc comments and annotations, such as @author, @version, etc.
If a piece of code within a class doesn't belong to the author of the class, please mention the source(web-site or author's name) using the @author annotation where necessary

Compile
=======

You need to have JDK on your machine to compile the project. Newest JDK for Windows/Mac/Linux can be found here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Run
===

To run you need to have JRE installed on your machine. If you install JDK it already has JRE inside, otherwise you can download JRE for Windows/Mac/Linux from here:
