Orion
=====

Orion is a java 2D Mario style game which will hopefully turn into a platformer game engine with easy API. The main purpose of the project is to learn and practise relatively clean java code and experiment with a wide range of API provided by Java SE libraries

Compile
=======

You need to have JDK on your machine to compile the project. Newest JDK for Windows/Mac/Linux can be found here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Run
===

To run you need to have JRE installed on your machine. If you install JDK it already has JRE inside, otherwise you can download JRE for Windows/Mac/Linux from here:
